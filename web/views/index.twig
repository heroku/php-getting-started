		<h2>Bird of Prey</h2>
		<p>
			Owls are nocturnal birds of prey. Owls mostly feed on invertebrates like
			spiders, worms, and other insects. Many species also feed on rodents and fish.
			They can swallow rodents whole, gross. Owls are known to surplus hunt, therefore,
			creating a cache of food. Prey are carried in the owl's strong talons.

		<h2>Owl Sounds</h2>
		<p>
			Owls are known for their hooting at night, but did you know that not all
			owls hoot? Barn Owls produce a screech that lasts for over two seconds!
			Screech owls make a sound that is the exact opposite of their name, they
			whistle! The Great Horned Owl and the Barred Owl make generic owl sounds
			that everyone knows and loves while listening to hooting all night long.

		<h2>Necks</h2>
		<p>
			An owl can turn its head around 270 degrees. Owls cannot move their eyes
			so they must resort to rotating their head to see in a different direction.
			The bird has a huge range of vision without having to move its entire body
			making it less noticeable in the wild.
